# Master Thesis: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Age Inventory Management with Complex Production Actions

This repo includes my master thesis at Technical University of Munich. The thesis aims to apply deep reinforcement learning in multi-age inventory management context.  
The researched problem is inventory control for Port wine based on the paper Deriving interpretable decision rules from optimal purchasing and blending policies in port wine inventory management (Pahr et. al., 2021) with combinatorial state space and action space.   
The deep reinforcement learning model is extended from the paper Growing Action Spaces (Farquhar et. al., 2020) with the focus on curriculum learning and transfer learning to improve efficiency of exploration process in action space.

Keywords: deep reinforcement learning, curriculum learning, transfer learning, multi-age inventory management

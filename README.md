# Master Thesis: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Age Inventory Management with Complex Production Actions

This repo includes my master thesis at Technical University of Munich. The thesis aims to apply deep reinforcement learning in multi-age inventory management context.
The researched problem is inventory control for Port wine based on Pahr A, Grunow M, Amorim P (2021). Deriving interpretable decision rules from optimal purchasing and blending policies in port wine inventory management. Forthcoming. 
The deep reinforcement learning model is extended from Farquhar G, Gustafson L, Lin Z, Whiteson S, Usunier N, Synnaeve G (2020). Growing Action Spaces. III HD, Singh A, eds. Proceedings of the 37th International Conference on Machine Learning, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 3040â€“3051.

Keywords: deep reinforcement learning, curriculum learning, multi-age inventory management
